## About Fast Text
fastText is a library for efficient learning of word representations and sentence classification.

### Requirements

**fastText** builds on modern Mac OS and Linux distributions.
Since it uses C++11 features, it requires a compiler with good C++11 support.
These include :

* (gcc-4.6.3 or newer) or (clang-3.3 or newer)

Compilation is carried out using a Makefile, so you will need to have a working **make**.
For the word-similarity evaluation script you will need:

* python 2.6 or newer
* numpy & scipy

<hr />

This node module requires **git** and **curl** to be installed on your system. Installation will fail without these.

## Documentation

You can find the complete documentation of this module at <a href="https://jazzyarchitects.github.io/fasttext-node/FastText.html">https://jazzyarchitects.github.io/FastText/docs/FastText.html</a>

## Example

To use this module in your code, you can import this directly:

```js
  const FastText = require('fasttext-node');
  
  const fastText = new FastText( /* {} library configurations */);
```

### Training

The module exposes a ___train___ method which can be used to train a new model. The training methodology is **supervised** learning.

```js
  const trainFileUri = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jazzyarchitects/fasttext-node/master/train.txt'
  const trainResult = await fastext.train(trainFileUri, 
    { /* options */ 
    epoch: 50,
    lr: 0.01
  });
```
The first argument is the location of training file. It can be a url or file path on local machine.

The train function is an asynchronous function which will return **true** after the training is finished.  
The options arguments is a JSON object with the following properties:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>epoch</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>Number of epochs</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lr</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>0.1</td>
    <td>Learning rate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>lrUpdateRate</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>Change the rate of updates for the learning rate</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>dim</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>100</td>
    <td>Size of word vectors</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ws</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Size of the context window</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>neg</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>Number of negatives sampled</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>wordNgrams</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Max length of word ngram</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>loss</td>
    <td>enum</td>
    <td>'ns'</td>
    <td>Loss function. Should be one of 'ns' 'hs' or 'softmax'</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>thread</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>Number of threads</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>model</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>training-model</td>
    <td>The path to save the model</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Prediction

After the training has finished, the model can be used to predict the labels of new strings.  

```js

  const options = {
    labelCount: 3
  }

  const result = await fastext.predict([
    'Custard Pudding tasting like raw eggs',
    'Is Himalayan pink salt the same as the pink salt used for curing?',
  ], options);

  // OR 

  const result = await fastext.predict(`
    Custard Pudding tasting like raw eggs
    Is Himalayan pink salt the same as the pink salt used for curing?`,
    options
  );
```
The predict function will return an array of predictions for each input. Each input should be on a different line in the string or in the form of an array.

The second argument to the predict function is a JSON object with the following options
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Parameter</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>labelCount</td>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Number of labels to return per input string</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>model</td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>training-model</td>
    <td>The file path of model to use for predicting the labels. Do NOT put any extension of model file (.bin or .vec)</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Example output:

```json
  [ 
    { 
      "input": "Custard Pudding tasting like raw eggs",
      "predictions":{ 
        "eggs": 0.607422,
        "egg-whites": 0.00390627,
        "frying": 0.00390627 
      } 
    },
    { 
      "input": "Is Himalayan pink salt the same as the pink salt used for curing?",
      "predictions": { 
        "salt": 0.166016,
        "flavor": 0.0136719, 
        "language": 0.0117188 
      } 
    } 
  ]
```

## Training

The file you use for training should be of the format:

```txt
  __label__food-safety __label__beans How long can I soak dried beans before they are considered inedible?
```

Each label should be prepended by '\_\_label\_\_' (double underscores), followed by the string whose label are specified in the line starting.  
Each string can have multiple labels attached to it.
